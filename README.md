# Dynamic Window Manager

[Tiếng Việt](https://github.com/xnplz/dwm/blob/master/README.vi.md)

#### What is dwm?
dwm (dynamic window manager) is a **open source, light and fast** window manager for X.
#### What did I modify in the source code?
I modified only the `config.h` library, and add some patches into the source to make it ~~**bloated**~~.
